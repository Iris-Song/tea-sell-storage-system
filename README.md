### background
Teahouses began to rise in the Song Dynasty and are one of the traditional industries in Chinese. With the development of modernization and the demand for chain expansion of the teahouse industry, teahouses need a more scientific sales and inventory management system to help them develop further. The business model of teahouses often has local characteristics, such as business based on "acquaintances" and frequent fluctuations in product prices. The conventional management system cannot well adapt to its management and sales model. Many practitioners hope to use modern management methods to help this traditional industry continue to develop.
